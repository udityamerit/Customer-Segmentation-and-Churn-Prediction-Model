## **Customer Segmentation and Churn Prediction Model**

### **Project Overview**
This project aims to:
1. Segment customers into clusters based on their demographic, spending, and engagement patterns.
2. Predict customer churn to help businesses focus their marketing efforts on retaining at-risk customers.

The app is built with **Streamlit**, using clustering (KMeans) and machine learning techniques for churn prediction. The model provides actionable insights to improve customer engagement and retention strategies.

### **Features**
1. **Dynamic Clustering**:
   - Users can choose the number of clusters (2 to 10) for segmentation.
   - Clustering helps group customers with similar characteristics for targeted campaigns.
2. **Churn Prediction**:
   - Key features like spending habits, age, income, and purchase frequency are used to predict churn probabilities.
3. **Visualization**:
   - PCA-based scatter plots to visualize customer segments.
   - Histograms for feature distribution across clusters.
4. **Marketing Strategy Recommendations**:
   - Tailored recommendations for each customer cluster.

### **How to Run**
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install streamlit pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```
2. Save the script as `customer segmentation.py`.
3. Run the app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run customer segmentation.py
   ```
4. Upload your dataset (`.csv` file) and explore clusters or churn predictions.

### **Model Description**
1. **Clustering**:
   - Features used: Age, Income, Spending, Purchases, Campaign Response Rates, etc.
   - Preprocessing includes missing value handling, scaling, and one-hot encoding.
   - PCA for dimensionality reduction and visualization.
   
2. **Churn Prediction**:
   - Supervised learning techniques (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) can be integrated for churn prediction.
   - Important features include customer spending, campaign response rates, and frequency of purchases.

### **Answers to Key Questions**

#### **1. How would you handle imbalanced data if churned customers are fewer than active ones?**
- **Oversampling**: Use techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to generate synthetic samples of the minority class.
- **Undersampling**: Randomly sample from the majority class to balance the dataset.
- **Class Weighting**: Modify the loss function of the model to penalize misclassifications of the minority class more heavily.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Use metrics like F1-score, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC instead of accuracy to evaluate the model performance on imbalanced data.

#### **2. What features are the most important predictors of churn?**
- **Total Spending**: High spending may correlate with loyalty, while erratic spending patterns may indicate potential churn.
- **Campaign Response Rate**: Customers who do not respond to marketing campaigns are more likely to churn.
- **Number of Purchases**: Lower purchase frequency can be an early indicator of churn.
- **Income**: Disposable income impacts purchasing behavior, which may relate to churn risk.
- **Web Visits**: High web visits without purchases may indicate dissatisfaction or exploration of alternatives.

#### **3. How would you explain the model's predictions to a non-technical business team?**
- **Cluster Analysis**: Use visualizations (e.g., PCA plots) to show how customers are grouped based on similar characteristics.
- **Key Metrics**: Present insights such as average age, spending, and income per cluster in simple terms.
- **Churn Insights**: Explain churn probabilities using concrete examples, such as "Customers who spend less than $50 per month and do not respond to campaigns are 3x more likely to churn."
- **Business Impact**: Highlight how retaining customers in high-risk clusters can increase revenue and customer lifetime value.

#### **4. What steps would you take to deploy this model into production?**
1. **Model Packaging**:
   - Save the trained model using a format like `pickle` or `joblib`.
   - Create a robust pipeline for preprocessing and predictions.
   
2. **API Development**:
   - Use **FastAPI** or **Flask** to expose the model as an API endpoint.
   - Ensure secure and scalable API endpoints.

3. **Integration**:
   - Embed the API in the existing CRM or marketing platforms.
   - Ensure the application can handle real-time inputs and predictions.

4. **Monitoring**:
   - Track model performance using dashboards (e.g., Grafana).
   - Monitor drift in data distribution and retrain the model as needed.

5. **Feedback Loop**:
   - Use feedback from business teams and customers to iteratively improve the model.
